In my room, I have a queen size bed, a desk with a chair and a dresser. When you walk inside the room you have a bed on the left against the wall and a window next to the bed. On the right there is a desk with a chair so that's the left and right side of the room, across from the door there is a dresser with my clothes. My plan is to switch places between my bed with the desk because I'll have more daylight while sitting and working at my desk. I can put my bed on the opposite side from where it was before so I can see when someone comes in. I'll leave the dresser like it is, maybe I can paint it a different color so it can match the rest of the furniture. I might also get a carpet so when I walk barefoot I won't be cold.
